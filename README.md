# Agentic Elephant Carpaccio 🐘

> **A hands-on training exercise exploring AI-assisted development through thin vertical slices**

## The Scenario

We've built a great product and Sales have beaten all expectations—signing customers far beyond our expectations. We now have a backlog of customers waiting to be onboarded.

To get the product to market fast, we deferred tooling and self-service onboarding. The product needs **a LOT of complex setup** to work 🤦‍♂️. Now the CS team is overloaded and can't keep up.

**We only get paid once customers are provisioned and fully set up successfully.**

### Your Mission

Build an internal tool that helps CS clear the onboarding queue faster.

**What's the smallest thing you can give them NOW?**

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install all dependencies (root, server, client)
npm run install:all

# Start the app (runs both server and client)
npm start
```

Then open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.

### Other Commands

| Command             | Description                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `npm start`         | Run full app (server + client) |
| `npm run server`    | Run backend only (port 3001)   |
| `npm run client`    | Run frontend only (port 5173)  |
| `npm run test:unit` | Run unit tests                 |
| `npm run test:e2e`  | Run Playwright e2e tests       |

### VSCode/Cursor/Windsurf

Press **F5** to launch the app with debugging enabled. See `.vscode/launch.json` for available configurations.

## Session Structure (60 minutes)

### Introduction & Framing

- This is **NOT** a coding competition
- You (probably) will **NOT finish the app** — that's intentional
- Success = _earliest usable value_, not completeness
- Huge Success = earliest usable value + fastest expansion in completeness
- **AI writes ALL code** — you decide what matters

**Elephant Carpaccio principles:**

- Thin slices
- Working software over completeness
- Tool MUST work at every iteration
- Always deliver something demonstrably more useful at each iteration

### Build Time (5 × 8-minute sprints)

**Rules:**

- Start from this base repo (fork for tools like Devin)
- Use any mix of AI & traditional tools
- Follow any methodology: TDD, manual testing, let users test in prod
- You own operations after sprint 1 — any regression reports from CS (facilitator) MUST be addressed over features
- The clock never stops: plan, implement, and demo within each sprint

### Demos & Reflection

Demo **whatever you reached**, no matter how small.

**Reflection questions:**

- What was your _first_ valuable slice?
- Where did AI accelerate you most?
- Where did it _not_ help?
- What did you _not_ build that you normally would?
- How did your workflow differ from your company's accepted norms?
- How comfortable are you that the company keeps using this tool so it can pay you?
- What would your next slice be with 10 more minutes?

## What's in This Repo

### Running Skeleton App

- ✅ App boots with single command
- ✅ Single page loads with "Onboarding Dashboard" heading

### Navigation Scaffold

- ✅ Dashboard (shows onboarding queue)
- ✅ Customer Info (placeholder)
- ✅ Data Mapping (placeholder)
- ✅ Tenant Setup (placeholder)
- ✅ Import (placeholder)

### Example Domain Models

```javascript
Customer {
  id, name, industry, region, contactEmail, createdAt
}

Tenant {
  id, customerId, status, plan, createdAt
}

OnboardingStep {
  id, name, status, order
}
```

### Seed Data

- 1 example customer: **Acme Corporation**
- 1 example onboarding state at 0% progress

### Progress Indicator

- ✅ Static checklist showing all steps as pending
- ✅ Progress bar at 0%

### Test Structure

- ✅ Unit tests: `npm run test:unit`

## Tech Stack

Intentionally boring and fast:

- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite
- **Backend:** Express.js
- **Storage:** In-memory only (no database)
- **Auth:** None
- **Styling:** Minimal CSS

---

## The Onboarding Process

> The full workflow involves:
>
> 1. **Collecting customer information** — validate and normalize data
> 2. **Data mapping** — map customer needs to platform configuration
> 3. **Tenant provisioning** — create and configure customer tenant
> 4. **Data import** — import customer data into the platform
>
> The process is complex, but customers want value **as early as possible**.

## Sample Data

The `sample-data/` directory contains test data from three fictional accounting customers, each using different data schemas and formats. This data is designed to test the application's ability to map varying schemas and data values to a target system.

See [sample-data/README.md](sample-data/README.md) for detailed documentation of the schema differences between customers.

### Sample Data Overview

| Customer               | Schema Style       | Date Format |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| ABC Accounting         | Title Case columns | MM/DD/YYYY  |
| XYZ Financial Services | camelCase columns  | YYYY-MM-DD  |
| Premier Bookkeeping    | snake_case columns | DD-MM-YYYY  |

Each customer folder contains:

- Clients (10-12 records)
- Contacts (15-20 records)
- Chart of Accounts (35-40 entries)
- Transactions (25 records)
